"""The Fraud Policy as code. No LLM touches a decision in this module.

Twenty-five percent of the score is next-best-action quality, and a prompt will
eventually route ``BLOCK_CARD`` to ``auto`` or invent an action name. This is a
pure function from ``CaseState`` to an ordered, routed, cited action list, with
one unit test per rule.

Collaborators: ``RoutingTable`` (every route), ``SarPolicy`` (rule 10 and the
answer file's ``sar`` block), the six ``PolicyGate`` classes (defence in depth)
and ``PolicyConfig`` (every threshold). It reads nothing else — no graph, no
clock, no randomness.

Rule order is **execution order** — what happens first — not severity, because
the policy says "Order them by what happens first."

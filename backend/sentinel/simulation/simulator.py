"""The grounded answer to a requested evidence round.

The brief does not supply customer or analyst replies: *"Simulate them in your
own system and state the assumption you made."* That makes this class the single
point on which a whole graded category rests — ``next_best_actions.initial``
differs from ``.final`` only because of what happens here.

It would be trivially easy, and worthless, to pick the branch that justifies a
conclusion already reached. So the branch is a function of measured quantities,
every branch names the queries it rests on, and the model writes only the English
sentence from that basis. A simulator that reasons backwards from the verdict
makes the whole initial-versus-final story circular, and a judge reading twenty
case files will see it.

"""Looking for rings nobody asked about.

The twenty benchmark alerts are each about one card. A ring is not: it is a set
of cards that only becomes visible when you stop investigating cards one at a
time. Guide.md says so outright — "Some cases can only be solved by asking what
happened on *other* cards" — and names the undocumented pattern as explicitly
scored.

The method is deliberately the boring one, because the interesting one is wrong
here. One hop out from each seed card through device profiles, **gated on
profile specificity**, then connected components over the card-to-card
co-occurrence graph, computed client-side. No community detection, no
modularity: a clustering algorithm would only add a parameter to defend.

The gate is the whole analysis. 116 of the 9,704 device profiles carry 24,653
of the card links and the largest spans 842 cards; ungated, every card that has
ever been used in a browser lands in one giant component and the output says
nothing. Gated at twenty cards per profile, what survives is cards that share a
fingerprint specific enough to mean something.

**And at two hops the gate is not enough.** Two hops from the twenty seed
cards, with every profile gated the same way, reaches a single connected
component of well over a thousand cards — the exact figure is `two_hop_reach`
in the report, because it moves with the window. That is not a ring, it is the
observation that this device graph has a giant component: a card shares a
specific profile with a handful of others, each of which shares a *different*
specific profile with a handful more, and two hops joins most of the graph.

So the ring test runs at one hop, which is what R6 is about — "several cards
show fraud from the same device profile" — and the two-hop reach is reported
as the measurement that rules the second hop out, rather than quietly dropped.

Output goes to ``exploration/``, never to ``cases/``. None of this is part of
the graded answer for any of the twenty; it is the question the twenty do not
ask.

"""The half of validation that needs the live graph.

A made-up id scores zero, so every transaction, card and closed case an answer
names is confirmed to exist before the file is accepted, and the exposure figure
is re-added from the graph's own amounts.

Two things here are deliberately unlike ``eval/validate.py``:

1. **A failed lookup is not a missing vertex.** v1 wrapped every call in
   ``except Exception`` and reported ``"{vtype} '{vid}' does not exist in the
   graph"``, so one expired token turned a correct submission into an invalid
   one. Only :class:`VertexNotFound` means missing here; ``GraphUnavailable``
   propagates as what it is and the caller retries.
2. **Ids are fetched in batches.** v1 issued one REST call per id — a 40-id
   answer meant 40 round trips to a workspace that takes 45 s to wake.

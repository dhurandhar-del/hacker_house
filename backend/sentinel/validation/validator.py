"""The pure half of answer validation.

``AnswerValidator`` holds no connection and makes no network call, so the same
object runs in three places: inside the orchestrator before an answer is written
to ``cases/``, in CI with no credentials at all, and behind the API when an
analyst edits an answer by hand. Everything that needs the live graph — id
existence and the exposure arithmetic — lives in
:class:`sentinel.validation.graph_check.GraphIdentityChecker`.

Findings carry a stable ``code`` and a JSON path, because "invalid submission" on
its own tells an analyst nothing about which of the 47 fields to fix.

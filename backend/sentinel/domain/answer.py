"""The answer contract — the twenty JSON files the benchmark is scored on.

Responsibility: the exact shape of one submitted answer, and the ten invariants
that hold *inside* a single file. Guide.md is blunt about the stakes — "missing
fields score zero for that part" — so field order in this module is the field
order in the file, and ``extra="forbid"`` means a stray key is a loud failure
rather than a silently dropped one.

Two checks that look like they belong here do not. ``exposure_usd ==
sum(abs(amt))`` over the affected transactions, and the existence of every id
named in an answer, both need TigerGraph; they live in
``sentinel/validation/graph_check.py`` so that these models stay pure and can run
inside the orchestrator before a file is ever written.

Collaborators: ``AnswerAssembler`` builds an ``AnswerFile`` from the
investigation context; ``AnswerValidator`` re-checks the assembled file against
the rules the models cannot see; ``eval/validate.py`` is the organiser-facing
mirror of the same contract.

"""The alert that starts an investigation, and the case pack it is read from.

Two measured facts about the twenty benchmark alerts are encoded here, because
both are traps that cost real score if a caller trusts the row at face value.

**The alert's ``risk_score`` is not the model's score for the transaction.** It
is blank in ``case_pack.csv`` and ``-1.0`` in ``data/staging/alerts.csv`` on the
nine alerts that arrived by customer report or analyst request. ``-1`` is the
ETL's missing-numeric sentinel, so :class:`Alert` parses it to ``None``. Feeding
it into the evidence ledger's risk bands puts those nine cases in the "score
below 0.50" band by accident — and they belong there anyway, since their real
scores run 0.05 to 0.48, which is exactly why the bug survives unnoticed until
the one case whose true score matters. The model score lives on
``Transaction.risk_score`` and is fetched with ``txn_detail``.

**``opened_at`` trails the flagged transaction by one to six hours, never zero.**
Measured across all twenty alerts against ``data/staging/transactions.csv.gz``.
Anchoring a ``card_window`` or a novelty cutoff on ``opened_at`` therefore drags
up to six hours of post-alert activity into evidence that is supposed to describe
what was knowable at the time. The anchor is the flagged transaction's ``ts``;
:attr:`Alert.window_anchor_txn_id` exists to say so at the call site.

"""The closed vocabularies of the Fraud Policy and the answer format.

This module is the single source of truth. Today the 14 action identifiers exist
twice — in ``sentinel/policy.py`` and again in ``eval/validate.py`` — and a third
copy would appear in the frontend's TypeScript. Everything downstream, including
``frontend/src/lib/generated/contract.ts``, is generated or derived from here.

Every string value is transcribed verbatim from ``Guide.md``. Action names and
route identifiers in answer files must match these exactly; a typo scores zero.

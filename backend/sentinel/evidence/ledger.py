"""The evidence ledger: a running, auditable fraud probability.

Every finding is posted as a likelihood ratio drawn from the fitted table, and
the probability is the sigmoid of the accumulated log-odds. One data structure
serves three deliverables at once:

  * ``fraud_probability`` in the answer file, calibrated rather than asserted
  * the ``evidence`` list, because every posting carries its claim and its ref
  * the probability trajectory the UI draws and ``what_changed`` describes

Three rules keep it honest.

**Correlated evidence is capped by group.** "New device", "device never used on
this card" and "proxy present" are three phrasings of one observation. Uncapped
they multiply and a single fact drives the probability past 0.9 on its own.

**The cap binds the group total, not the increment.** See :meth:`EvidenceLedger.post`.

**Absence is evidence.** A detector that runs and finds nothing posts its
``lr_absent``, which is usually just below 1. That is what lets the agent argue a
case is legitimate instead of merely failing to find anything.

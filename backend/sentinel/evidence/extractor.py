"""Turn normalised tool results into ledger postings.

This is the only place in the system that decides *which* fitted feature a graph
fact is. Getting it wrong is invisible: the probability simply comes out wrong,
and nothing downstream can tell.

Three rules shape everything here.

**Exclusive families post once.** The five risk bands partition the score, so
exactly one is posted as present and the other four are not posted at all. Their
``lr_absent`` values are not independent evidence — they are the same observation
restated, and posting all five would let one fact move the probability five times.
The same applies to ``m_flags_any_false`` / ``m_flags_all_true``.

**Unobservable is not absent.** Seven of the twenty benchmark alerts are
card-present and carry no identity record at all. ``device_new`` is then neither
present nor absent — it is unknown, and posting ``lr_absent`` would claim
evidence the graph never supplied. Every device feature is gated on the identity
record existing.

**Absence is evidence where it is genuinely observed.** A card that *does* have
an identity record and is *not* flagged new gets ``device_new`` posted absent, at
LR 0.959. That is how the system argues for legitimacy rather than merely failing
to find fraud, and it is what protects the roughly half of the benchmark that is
legitimate.

"""Case write-back: the graph is where the memory lives, not a local file.

The brief asks for two separate things and it is worth keeping them apart. The
answer *file* is the submission. The `FraudCase` *vertex* is the memory — it is
what makes the nineteenth case able to retrieve the third one, inside the same
run, through the same retriever that reaches the bank's 5,565 closed cases.
Writing only the file would satisfy the grader's file check and quietly fail the
requirement it exists to demonstrate.

Eight edge types connect a case to the entities it is about. They are written
even when the run's verdict is `legitimate`: an exonerated card that is alerted
again next month should retrieve the reason it was cleared.

Two things from v1's ``sentinel/memory.py`` are deleted rather than ported:

- **`_customer_id` / `_card_id` smuggled into the answer dict.** Private keys
  inside a scored payload. :class:`CaseWriteRequest` carries them as fields.
- **`_device_key_for_label`**, which string-interpolated a label into an
  interpreted GSQL scan of all 9,704 `DeviceProfile` vertices. The device key is
  already in the sweep's results; nothing needs to go looking for it.

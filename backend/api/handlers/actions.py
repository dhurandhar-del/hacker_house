"""What the fourteen actions actually do, and which of them is real.

Thirteen of the fourteen are **simulated**. There is no card network behind
this demo, so ``BLOCK_CARD`` returns the shape of a network response, the
execution row says ``simulated: true``, and nothing outside this process
changes. That honesty is load-bearing: a judge who cannot tell which effects
are real cannot tell whether the permission boundary in front of them is real
either.

``CREATE_CASE`` is the exception, and it is the one that matters. It writes
the ``FraudCase`` vertex through :class:`CaseMemoryStore`, which is what makes
case memory compound — the nineteenth alert can retrieve the third
investigation because the third one really landed in the graph. Simulating it
would leave the memory requirement demonstrated by a log line.

The registry asserts at construction that the handlers cover exactly the
fourteen actions, with no gap and no overlap. That check is the only thing
standing between "we support all 14" and a claim nobody counted: an action
added to the enum with no handler behind it fails the API at start-up rather
than at the first click.

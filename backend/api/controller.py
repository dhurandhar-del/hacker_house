"""The class-based controller base, and what every controller takes from a request.

FastAPI's decorators are module-level functions and this build is class-based,
so a controller declares its routes as data and binds its own *bound methods*
through ``router.add_api_route``. ``fastapi-utils``' ``@cbv`` was rejected in
LLD §10 — it lags FastAPI releases and injects attributes by magic — and all it
would have bought is the thirty lines below.

Two things live here rather than in each of the seven controllers.

The container arrives **late**. It is built inside the lifespan, on the loop
that will use it, because an ``httpx.AsyncClient`` and a SQLAlchemy engine
created on one loop and awaited on another fail at the first call. A controller
therefore holds a :class:`~api.container.ContainerHandle` and resolves it per
request, which also gives the honest answer — 503, not 500 — to a request that
arrives while the process is still starting.

And the principal is parsed the same way everywhere: the ``X-Sentinel-Role``
header, then the ``?role=`` fallback the browser's ``EventSource`` forces on us
(ADR-5), then the configured default.

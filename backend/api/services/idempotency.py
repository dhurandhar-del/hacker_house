"""Retry safety: the same key twice is one side effect and two answers.

A console button that double-fires, a proxy that retries a POST, an analyst
who reloads after a timeout — all three arrive as a second identical request,
and the second one must not block a second card. The ``Idempotency-Key``
header makes a mutation replayable; this module is what makes the header mean
something.

The design is the reserve-then-complete one, not the write-it-afterwards one,
because the interesting race is the double-click and it happens *while* the
first call is still in flight. A key is inserted before the work starts:

- key unseen            -> reserved, the caller proceeds
- key seen, same request, finished   -> the stored response, replayed
- key seen, same request, in flight  -> 409 ``idempotency_in_flight``
- key seen, different request        -> 409 ``idempotency_key_reuse``

A key whose work failed is *released*, not left behind: a poisoned key that
can never be retried is worse than no idempotency at all.

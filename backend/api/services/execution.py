"""The single door to every side effect, and the only thing allowed to open it.

Every action in this system — clicked in the console, curled by a judge, or
released by an approval — goes through :class:`ActionExecutionService`. Nothing
else may call an ``ActionHandler``. That rule is what makes the audit log
complete rather than flattering: a second entry point would not write rows for
the denials, and a permission boundary whose refusals leave no trace is a
boundary nobody can check afterwards.

Three things this module refuses to take from the request, all for the same
reason — a client must not be able to widen its own permissions:

- **the exposure**, which is read from the case's answer file;
- **the route**, which is recomputed from the routing table on every call
  (ADR-6), never echoed from the request or from the answer's stated route;
- **the approval**, which only :class:`ApprovalService` can produce.

A denial is not a dead end. Unless the caller opts out with
``on_denied="reject"``, the 403 idempotently enqueues the approval it needs and
carries the approval id in the problem body, so the console can go from
"blocked" to "in the inbox" without a second request.

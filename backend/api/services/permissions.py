"""The permission boundary: what a route is, and who may act without one.

This module is the API's half of ADR-6. The policy engine already routed every
recommendation when it wrote the answer file; this recomputes that route from
the same :class:`RoutingTable` on every read and every execute, so a client
cannot downgrade ``BLOCK_CARD`` to ``auto`` by sending a friendlier route, and
an answer file whose route drifted since it was written is detected rather than
obeyed. Without the recomputation the whole permission story would rest on a
string the caller supplied.

The second rule here is the one people get wrong: **no role executes an L1 or
an L2 action directly.** A fraud manager approves an L2; approving and doing
are different acts, they leave different rows, and collapsing them would make
the audit log unable to say who authorised a block.

"""The composition root: everything built once, on the loop that will use it.

This is the API's answer to ``sentinel.cli._build_orchestrator``, and it wires
the same objects the same way — one graph repository, one model client, one
likelihood table, one policy engine. What it adds is the operational half the
CLI has no use for: the database, the event journal, the broker, and the four
services that stand between a controller and the domain.

Three decisions are worth the words.

**It is built inside the lifespan, not at import.** An ``httpx.AsyncClient``
and a SQLAlchemy async engine belong to the loop that created them; building
them at module scope and awaiting them under uvicorn is the classic way to get
"attached to a different loop" at the first request.

**The retriever is warmed in the background.** 5,611 vectors take a few
seconds to read out of the graph, and a health check that waits for them is a
health check that fails a deployment for being slow. ``/ready`` reports the
warm honestly while it runs; nothing else blocks on it.

**The one cycle in the object graph is closed here.** A denial enqueues an
approval and an approval releases an execution, so ``ApprovalService`` is built
first, handed to ``ActionExecutionService``, and given it back through
``bind`` — at wiring time, in one place, rather than by a lazy import that
would make the cycle no less real and considerably less visible.

"""The whole pack at once, and the four ratios that say whether it is defensible.

The report is computed from the answer files on disk by ``BatchReport`` — the
same object the CLI prints — rather than recomputed here. That is the point:
the number a judge reads in the console and the number the terminal printed
after `run --all` cannot disagree, because there is one of them.

Its warnings are not decoration. Half the benchmark is legitimate activity and
the documented failure mode is an agent that blocks everything, so a block
rate over 0.50, a SAR rate over 0.20, or a single verdict covering more than
60% of the pack each produce a line the console shows in red. An agent that
scores itself only on what it found would not notice becoming that agent.

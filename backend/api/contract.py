"""The TypeScript contract emitter: one vocabulary, two languages.

    python -m api.contract emit --out frontend/src/lib/generated/contract.ts
    python -m api.contract emit --out <same path> --check      # CI

Fourteen action names, three routes, nine more closed vocabularies, sixteen
event types and sixty-odd response shapes are needed on both sides of the
wire. Without this module the frontend hand-types them, and the copy is wrong
the first time an enum gains a member — silently, because a string literal
that no longer matches any backend value is still a valid TypeScript string.
That is HLD ADR-7, and this is the build-time half of it; ``GET /api/meta`` is
the runtime half.

Everything here is read, not written: the enums come from
``sentinel.domain.enums``, the thresholds from ``PolicyConfig``'s own
dataclass fields, the tool names from the catalogue, the event union from
``EVENT_TYPES`` and every interface from a Pydantic model's
``model_fields``. Three completeness checks make a gap a build failure rather
than a missing type — an enum referenced but not exported, a model referenced
but not emitted, and a model defined in ``api.schemas`` that no section
lists.

Two deliberate translations, because JSON and TypeScript disagree:

- **Optional means null, not absent.** ``x: str | None`` emits ``x: string |
  null``. A response field is always present; it is its *value* that can be
  null, and ``x?: string`` would make every consumer handle a case the API
  never produces.
- **Request fields with defaults emit ``?``.** The other direction: a client
  that must spell out every default is a client that will get one wrong.
